Tavenem.Time
==

Tavenem.Time provides classes capable of accurately representing extremely large and small time
intervals, suitable for time scales such as the age of a universe, with precision down to Planck
time.

## Installation

Tavenem.Time is available as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Tavenem.Time/).

## Roadmap

Tavenem.Time is a relatively stable library. Although additions and bugfixes are possible at any time, release should generally be expected to folow the .NET release cycle, with one or more preview releases during a framework preview, and a new stable release coinciding with the release of a new .NET framework major version.
